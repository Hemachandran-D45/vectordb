Vector database is a database used for storing high dimentional vector such as word embedding or image embedding
from high dimensional data like doc,jpeg,pdf to high dimensional vector the store in vector db

Why we need Vector DR
Over 80 to 85% data out there is unstructured data and we cant easily store them into a Relational or Traditonal database( MySql, Postgre SQL, Sqlite)
Cuz Rigit in Schema ( row and tabel), Scalability challenges (cant able to handle large volume of unstructure data), complexity in retrieval and process and we can do thatbut this is hard idea.
images is nothing but pixel and relational database doesn't know how to query out similar kind of image.
due to this database like NoSql used, they offer greater flexibility,scalability, and efficiency in handling unstructured data.

To overcome this issue, Concept introduce Vector embedding
When we have unstructure data like video,audio,text we need to apply embedding model
Embedding model is nothing but neural network model(deep learning model) and it is vector representation of object , a sentence any input
(basically embedding is converting object to number )
Using this embedding model , first we generating the embedding like a VECTOR 

Set of Object -----> Embedding Model ----------> Object as Vector
Text ----> Embedding Model(openai model) --------> Vector Embedding ------> Vector Storage(Database)
These kind of vector embedding has function called similar search 

Embedding Models:
	Open AI Embedding ---> GPT model
	Hugging Face Embedding ----> Opensource LLM
	Llama2 Embedding ---> Facebook
	Google Palm Embedding ---> GOogel


Issue :
	Whenever we search an similar vector ,It use distance formula but it took time cuz it calculate one by one all the vector
So main problem is time , To over come this issue they introduce indexes 

Vector Indexes:
	Whenever having kind of unstructure data where applying embedding model and generate kind of embedding vector
So on the top this embedding it is trying to add index. Index is data structure to find out similar kind of high dimensional data,
enabling fast similarity searches and nearest neighbor queries.
A Vector database indexes and store vector embedding for faster retrieval and similarity search.

Use cases of Vector DB:
1) Long Term memory for LLMs
2) Semantic Search : Search based on the meaning of context
3) Similarity Search: Text, Images, Videos, Audios
4) Recommmendation engine as well

Some widely used vector DB:
	Chromadb, FAISS(scalable search with facebook AI) - Local DB
	Weaviate,PineCone, redis - Cloud Based
